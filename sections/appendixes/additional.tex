\caption{
Illustration of the decrease in classification error rate
with larger sets of training data \cite{HastieTF09}.
By artificially limiting the available number of data points $n$,
one can create a similar curve to verify that
there is enough statistics in the training data
for the complexity of the model under consideration.
Ideally the curve should reach a clear asymptote before the maximum $n$ is used.
