comparison ops: >, >=, =, <>, BETWEEN, LIKE, IN
logical ops: AND, OR, NOT */

-- aggregation commands
SELECT count(1) AS 'nrows' FROM t;

-- GROUP BY
SELECT state,COUNT(id) FROM t GROUP BY state

-- Use HAVING with an aggregate func, not WHERE
SELECT state,COUNT(id) FROM t GROUP BY state

-- WITH / subqueries
