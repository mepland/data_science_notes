\section{Time Series Analysis}
\label{additional:time_series}

Time series analysis is the study of time-dependent data such as price over time.
Similar to regression models we aim to fit a model
to the data in order to make future predictions,
with a variety of potential models to choose from,
each with their own assumptions and use cases.
The problem can be attacked from two general directions,
frequency-domain methods and time-domain methods,
but we shall focus primarily on the time-domain here.
